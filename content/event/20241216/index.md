title: 'VRtual Societies - Breaking Bias With Virtual Reality: A Game-Changing Experiment'
summary: A recent study demonstrates virtual reality's (VR) potential to reduce prejudice through intergroup contact, showing that cooperative VR interactions can positively shift explicit attitudes (in Finland) and reduce implicit biases (in Italy) toward minority groups. However, the study also highlights that the effectiveness of VR interventions depends heavily on fostering cooperation, as competitive scenarios had no impact on attitudes.
