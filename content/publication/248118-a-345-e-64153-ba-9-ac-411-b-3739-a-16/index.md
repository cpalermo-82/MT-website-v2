abstract: While decreasing negative attitudes against outgroups are often reported
  by individuals themselves, biasedbehaviour prevails. This gap between words and
  actions may stem from unobtrusive mental processes that couldbe uncovered by using
  neuroimaging in addition to self-reports. In this study we investigated whether
  addingneuroimaging to a traditional intergroup bias measure could detect intersubject
  differences in intergroup biasprocesses in a societal context where opposing discrimination
  is normative. In a sample of 43 Finnish students,implicit behavioural measures failed
  to indicate intergroup bias against Middle Eastern and Muslim immigrants,and explicit
  measures reported rather positive attitudes and sentiments towards that targeted
  group. Yet, whileimplementing a repeatedly validated method for detecting intergroup
  bias, an implicit association paradigmpresenting stereotypical ingroup and outgroup
  face stimuli while undergoing magnetoencephalography, wedetected a clear neural
  difference between two experimental conditions. The neural effect is thought to
  reflectintergroup bias in the valence of the associations that faces evoke. The
  activity cluster of the neural bias peakedin BA37 and included significant activity
  in the fusiform gyrus, which has been repeatedly found to be activeduring face perception
  bias. Importantly, this neural pattern was driven by participants who were explicitlyfavourable
  of immigration – but to a lesser extent than others. These findings suggest that
  such variations inexplicit support of immigration are associated with the differential
  neural sensitivity to the congruency of as-sociations between intergroup faces and
  valence. This research showcases the potential of neuroimaging tounravel covert
  perceptual bias against outgroup members and its sensitivity to small variations
  in explicitattitudes.
