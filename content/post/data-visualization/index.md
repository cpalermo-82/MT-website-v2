title: Virtual Reality Shows Potential to Reduce Prejudice Across Groups
summary: A new study suggests that positive cooperative interactions in virtual reality (VR) can reduce prejudice not only towards the group directly involved but also extend positive attitudes to other unrelated outgroups, a phenomenon called the secondary transfer effect (STE). However, the study also indicates that competitive VR interactions may hinder this effect and that VR primarily influences explicit, rather than implicit, biases.
