title: 'Virtual Realities, Real Change: New Frontiers in Tackling Bias with VR and Embodiment'
summary: In this episode, we dive into the world of Virtual Reality and prejudice reduction. We explore whether embodying a different avatar can truly build empathy, when these immersive experiences might backfire and inadvertently increase bias, how researchers are using VR to tackle real-world problems like hiring discrimination and what the future holds for this powerful technology. The episode features Cassandra Crone and Dr Matilde Tassinari. We learned a lot from them, so we hope you enjoy the conversation as well!
